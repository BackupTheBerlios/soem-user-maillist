<PRE>Hello,

I'm trying to get the Beckhoff AX5112 to work with SOEM.

This device requires distributed clocks and the only example program I
could find that used DC was red_test.c, so i changed it to call
ec_init instead of ec_init_redundant. This means it is basically a
simple test program with DC capabilities (right?). This change got me
as far as PRE_OP.

The second change is in ethercatconfig.c, where i had to add a lot of
SoE commands required for this device (got them from a TwinCAT xml
file). This got me as far as SAFE_OP.

Now, whenever I try to go to OPERATIONAL, it fails. SOEM reports that
the slave status is 0x14 and the status code is 0x1A (Synchronization
error). Also, the drive display says: &quot;0xF415: IO Sync Lost&quot;. This
gives me the strong suspicion it has something to do with DC. I was
wondering if any of you have any idea how to solve this issue?

I could supply a wireshark capture if needed (from SOEM and/or another
master (which is not open source and has a lot of other problems) that
is able to get this drive to OPERATIONAL although I couldn't find any
significant differences).

Best regards,

Hidde
