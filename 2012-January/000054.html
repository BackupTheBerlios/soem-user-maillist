<PRE> Hi, I'm having some trouble getting my ethercat system running.

 At the moment I'm just trying to talk between a micro controller
 and a ET1100 chip, they are connected directly MAC-to-MII-port
 as described in the documentation.

 I have an oscilloscope so I have confirmed that data is actually
 going out on the lines. I also see the ECAT Processing Unit Error
 Counter increase by the same amount as the number of packets I
 send. I've also verified that the port is considered open and
 configured in the proper mode on the ethercat chip.

 What I can't figure out is why the packets get treated as errors
 by the ET1100. As both fields of the RX Error Counter remain at 0
 (although as there is no PHY the high byte should always remain
 at zero?) I'm starting to think that the packets arrive just fine
 as far as ethernet goes, but something is wrong with the ethercat
 header and datagrams. I'm using SOEM 1.2.5 for this and I'm just
 the slaveinfo.c example.

 What I'm seeing in Wireshark is that the ethernet driver sends 3
 frames that appear to be correct, apart from one thing that
 confuses me. They lack any padding and are only 30 bytes in length,
 each. As far as I can see the ethercat protocol requires packets
 to be padded to a minimum of 64 bytes. Is this correct? Could this
 be the source of my troubles?

 Any direction would be appreciated!

 Regard,

 Mattias Ekstr&#246;m
