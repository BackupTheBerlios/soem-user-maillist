<PRE>Forwarding this message to the mailing list because I accidentally
replied directly to Arthur.

&gt;<i> It works but it is not a nice coding practice.
</I>
I'm aware. For now, we're doing it just to keep it simple... in
practice, I have a template that allows me to go through all our pdos
and assign their addresses in memory to pointers. It's even cleaner
that way.


&gt;&gt;<i> However, although it starts off working fine, after some indeterminate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amount of time it will begin counting incorrectly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It does look as a network layer problem. If the NIC can't output the data as
</I>&gt;<i> fast as SOEM is inserting it in the socket buffers, there will be packets
</I>&gt;<i> dropped. Make a wireshark trace and make sure the packet timing is correct.
</I>&gt;<i> The tx and rx latency of a packet should not be more than 100us combined. If
</I>&gt;<i> it is more then you probably have interrupt mitigation on. With tools like
</I>&gt;<i> ethtool you can inspect and set the nic configuration parameters. The
</I>&gt;<i> drvcomment.txt file in the SOEM distribution gives an example. Unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> the settings are different for all drivers.
</I>
We did find how long the receive was taking to be oddly long. On a
different computer (the computer we use on the robot), that latency is
&lt;100us... on my new devel machine, it is closer to 300us. I will take
a look at reconfiguring those settings.

However, I am still curious how driver configuration issues could
corrupt our process data. Shouldn't these settings just slow our
communication down?

&gt;<i> SOEM does not buffer any data. The socket layer can, and does. How much
</I>&gt;<i> buffer depends on numerous factors, but a few MB is not an exception.
</I>&gt;<i> Because EtherCAT is balanced it must receive one packet for every packet
</I>&gt;<i> transmitted. SOEM makes a RAW packet and tries to deliver to the socket. If
</I>&gt;<i> this does not succeed SOEM just continues and sees this via the timeout
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism. If the the socket accepts the packet SOEM stores it in a small
</I>&gt;<i> buffer (default 16 entries) to compare against incoming packets. If the
</I>&gt;<i> index of a received packet matches one in the Tx buffer the data is paired.
</I>&gt;<i> When the socket buffer is lager than the maximum index count (16) then
</I>&gt;<i> possibly the incoming packet is matched against the wrong tx packed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to prevent this issue,
</I>&gt;<i> 1. make sure the NIC driver is set correctly so it can keep up with the
</I>&gt;<i> speed.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. do not send packets when the link is down
</I>
Not a concern in production... if the link goes down, the emergency
stop will activate in less than three ms.

&gt;<i> 3. make the socket buffers as small as possible
</I>
Will try that, along with your other suggestions.
