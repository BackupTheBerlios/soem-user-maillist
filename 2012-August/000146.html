<PRE>Hi all, 
 
First post on this.
I'm trying to use SOEM EtherCAT master to trigger the bunch of leds on
the TI AM3359 ICE dev kit.
 
I have not modified the TI SSC nor the XML configuration file so am
still running:
FreeRun-Mode
LEDs @ 0x7010 connected onto RxPDO @ 0x1601 using SM2 @ 0x1800 with
assignment made on RxPDO assign @ 0x1c12.
 
1) First Question: 
assignment made on 0x1c12 is on subindex 1 with value 0x1600.
What I can see from the Ebox.c example is that writing 0x1601 in this
register 0x1c12 sets a stream mode when 0x1600 sets a standard mode.
Could you describe those modes or refer to a document that does?
 
2) Second Question:
I have not been able to modify the status of the LEDs. 
I'm trying to set up the slave[1].inputs to a hex value(0x55 for
example) and then use ec_send_processdata().
Does that seem wrong?
Not sure what to do?
 
Some UART debug have been injected in the TI SSC so I can see what's
going on.
My problem is in the function PDO_OutputMapping where I can see the
address 0x1800 being scanned for data on each interrupt (being in
FreeRun-Mode).
I don't understand why this address is scanned.
 
Note that I've never used CANopen nor EtherCAT before and am in a
learning/understanding process.
 
Best Regards,
 
Jeremie
