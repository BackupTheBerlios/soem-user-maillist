<PRE>Hi Arthur, Hi all,

Thank you Arthur, for your clear and detailed answer.

As you have understood my slave decides which mode to use in the pre-op to
safe-op transition.
Moreover my slave has a counter [that can be deactivated] to verify if it
has received valid PDO in last sync0 cycles.
&quot;The Internal Error Counter is incremented by 3 if the process output data
is not updated (a no Receive (SM2)
event occurs) at Sync0 event. When the process output data is normally
updated, the Internal Error Counter is
decremented by 1. The Internal Error Counter is reset when the ESM state is
transited to OP from SAFEOP.&quot;

However, about the command sequence, I haven't understood what you mean
with &quot;activate process data transfer&quot; just after having started DC.
About &quot;map slaves&quot; with &quot;ec_config_map()&quot;, I have used the normal command
but I do it after activating sync0.

The sequence of orders that I have, and that is working with DC with sync0
events every millisecond is:
- ec_init()
- discovery of slaves: ec_config_init()
- pre-op
- start DC: ec_configdc()
- activate sync0
- map slaves: ec_config_map()
- safe-op
- wait for all slaves to reach safe-op
- op
- wait for all slaves to reach op
- do your important stuff..

In this situation the slave can work with no problems. Moreover I can
verify that the synchronisation of the ec_send/receive is well done because
in this case I can let the counter active and it never generate any alarm.

My questions would be:
1)My command sequence is correct? Above all, is it correct activate sync0
before doing ec_config_map?

2) The slave I have is working well with a sync0 every 1ms but when I try
to use a sync0 of 125us [that is the lower one that is permitted with my
slave] the counter counts to many sync0 events before the first PDO and
generate an alarm before I can reach operational.
I'm quite sure that I don't reach operational and come back, I simply never
get operational because the alarm generated by the counter.
As you has explained I can use the shift of the sync0 to  prevent time-outs
of the slaves in fact using a sync0 of 1ms I set it to 10ms in order to
avoid any alarm generated by the counter but this way doesn't seem to work
when using 125us. Any idea of what it's going on?
To work with a sync0 every 125us I have to deactivate the counter of my
Slave that is possible, but a loose of security.
There is, in your opinion, another solution? I don't understand why using
the shift I can' t avoid the alarm.

Best regards
Luca
