&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>    Is it common? ...because in ebox.c it is called when the ebox it's

</I>&gt;<i>    Anyway, calling ec_sync0() in pre-op the drivers sometimes don't 
</I>&gt;<i> reach the operational state. But it seem to be casual...of course I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> doing something wrong.
</I>For a decent programmed slave it should not matter when the sync signal 
is activated. It should just lock to the signal whenever it is 
available. This is the case with our ebox slaves. However a lot of slave 
vendors are very picky with regard to synchronisation.

I think you have a slave that decides what mode to use in the pre-op to 
safe-op transition. The slave reads the sync0 registers from the PDI 
side to check if the master has programmed DC with sync0 in the slave.

You can prevent sync errors in your slave when rewrite the standard SOEM 
sequence to:
- init
- discovery of slaves
- pre-op
- map slaves
- start DC
- activate process data transfer
- wait for DC lock
- activate sync0
- safe-op
- wait for all slaves to reach safe-op
- op
- wait for all slaves to reach op
- do your important stuff.....

The issue with the standard SOEM order is that map en safe-op is in the 
same function. So you have to disable the safe-op request in 
ec_config_map().
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2)Which is the meaning of the shift in the command ec_sync0()?
</I>&gt;<i> It's not the shift between ec_send/receive and DC clock because it is 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;manually setted&quot; in ebox.c inside the function ec_sync() and of 
</I>&gt;<i> course it isn't the shift of the inputs and outputs of the slaves.
</I>from ethercaddc.c:
/** 1st sync pulse delay in ns here 100ms */
#define SyncDelay       ((int32)100000000)

     wc = ec_FPRD(slaveh, ECT_REG_DCSYSTIME, sizeof(t1), &amp;t1, 
EC_TIMEOUTRET); /* read local time of slave */
     t1 = etohll(t1);

     /* Calculate first trigger time, always a whole multiple of 
CyclTime rounded up
     plus the shifttime (can be negative)
     This insures best sychronisation between slaves, slaves with the 
same CyclTime
     will sync at the same moment (you can use CyclShift to shift the 
sync) */
     if (CyclTime &gt; 0)
     {
         t = ((t1 + SyncDelay) / CyclTime) * CyclTime + CyclTime + 
CyclShift;
     }

So the slave gets triggered at the next whole multiple of the cycltime 
plus the cycle shift + 100ms. And then every cycletime. You can use the 
shift for two purposes:
1. offset the trigger moment of slave y in relation to slave x.
2. offset the trigger in multiple cycles. For example if your cycle time 
is 1ms and the shift is 1000ms then the first sync pulse is delayed 
another 1sec.

Option 2 can be used to prevent time-outs of the slaves PDO to sync check.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3)I haven't understand yet, if while the use of DC is activated in a 
</I>&gt;<i> slave I can send asynchronous SDO too or only synchronous PDO.
</I>You can use both synchonous and asynchronous PDOs. EtherCAT and SOEM 
have no limitations. However some slaves can't handle that and throw an 
error (or worse, crash). To be honest, the  synchronous solutions in a 
lot of slaves are just crap. Your slave seems to be one of those.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for any kind of hint or idea
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards
