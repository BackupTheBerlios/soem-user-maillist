<PRE>Hi all,

i wonder if anyone could give me a hint.

I'm trying to use the master as a reference clock for the DC
synchronization; after many search on the internet I've guessed that, if I
want to use my master as a reference clock, the only thing that I have to do
is to send a BWR to all slaves  with the master local time (again I guess
that the register I have to update is the 0x910.in all the document I've
looked at its not explicitly said).  

I've modified my source code in order to do so but what I see now is that
the master clock time and the slave time are drifting, very very slowly but
still drifting and I can't find a reason for this; I have to say that my
master relays on a software timer with a granularity of 100 ns and updated
every 5 us, it's a very bad timer compared to the one of the slave (with 1
ns granularity) but what I was expecting was a jitter of more or less 5 us
(the update time of my master clock) but not a drift.

 

Anyone have any idea on how to use the master as a reference clock??

 

Thanks in advance, 

 

Francesco Boschetti
