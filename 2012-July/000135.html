&gt;<i> We are implementing a 1kHz robot control system using SOEM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are having issues with data consistency. In our case, our first
</I>&gt;<i> RxPDO is a UINT8, and we are attempting to create a counter in this
</I>&gt;<i> PDO. Our final system will run within Orocos, but we've verified these
</I>&gt;<i> issues without using Orocos.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To execute this increment, we are using the following code (right
</I>&gt;<i> before ec_send_processdata()):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (ec_slave[1].outputs[0])++;
</I>It works but it is not a nice coding practice.
First off all .outputs is defined as
uint8 *outputs
So you should do (*ec_slave[1].outputs)++;
And better to use:
uint8 *myslaveoutput;

myslaveoutput = ec_slave[1].outputs;

(*myslaveoutput)++;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, although it starts off working fine, after some indeterminate
</I>&gt;<i> amount of time it will begin counting incorrectly.
</I>It does look as a network layer problem. If the NIC can't output the 
data as fast as SOEM is inserting it in the socket buffers, there will 
be packets dropped. Make a wireshark trace and make sure the packet 
timing is correct. The tx and rx latency of a packet should not be more 
than 100us combined. If it is more then you probably have interrupt 
mitigation on. With tools like ethtool you can inspect and set the nic 
configuration parameters. The drvcomment.txt file in the SOEM 
distribution gives an example. Unfortunately the settings are different 
for all drivers.

&gt;<i> Further, if we disconnect the EtherCAT slave for a couple of seconds,
</I>&gt;<i> then on reconnect it will send out packets as fast as possible, as if
</I>&gt;<i> the data is being buffered somewhere. Does SOEM do this, or does this
</I>&gt;<i> occur within the kernel? During the disconnection, our code continues
</I>&gt;<i> running at 1 kHz and it does not speed up when connection is
</I>&gt;<i> re-established.
</I>SOEM does not buffer any data. The socket layer can, and does. How much 
buffer depends on numerous factors, but a few MB is not an exception. 
Because EtherCAT is balanced it must receive one packet for every packet 
transmitted. SOEM makes a RAW packet and tries to deliver to the socket. 
If this does not succeed SOEM just continues and sees this via the 
timeout mechanism. If the the socket accepts the packet SOEM stores it 
in a small buffer (default 16 entries) to compare against incoming 
packets. If the index of a received packet matches one in the Tx buffer 
the data is paired. When the socket buffer is lager than the maximum 
index count (16) then possibly the incoming packet is matched against 
the wrong tx packed.

So to prevent this issue,
1. make sure the NIC driver is set correctly so it can keep up with the 
speed.
2. do not send packets when the link is down
3. make the socket buffers as small as possible
