<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>We are implementing a 1kHz robot control system using SOEM.

We are having issues with data consistency. In our case, our first
RxPDO is a UINT8, and we are attempting to create a counter in this
PDO. Our final system will run within Orocos, but we've verified these
issues without using Orocos.

To execute this increment, we are using the following code (right
before ec_send_processdata()):

(ec_slave[1].outputs[0])++;

However, although it starts off working fine, after some indeterminate
amount of time it will begin counting incorrectly. By executing a
printf statement after the preceding line, I see that the value of
ec_slave[1].outputs[0] changes as follows:

14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25
243
26
26
244
27
27
245
28
28
246
29
29
247
30
30
248
31
31

This does not always trigger at the value 25... all values seem
equally probably.

Further, if I count in a separate, local variable:

int num = 0;

while (&lt;condition&gt;) {
    if (num != ec_slave[1].outputs[0])
        printf(&quot;%u\t%u\n&quot;, num, ec_slave[1].outputs[0]);

    ec_slave[1].outputs[0] = ++num;

    ec_send_processdata();
    ec_receive_processdata(500);

    usleep(sleeptime);
}

I will eventually see that ec_slave[1].outputs[0] is counting slightly
behind num. (Note: it may be 1, 2, 3, or maybe more behind).

I will note that this seems to occur more often when the EtherCAT
slave was recently reset. It also seems to occur fairly consistently
if the EtherCAT slave is unplugged from the master for a couple of
seconds (less than 10, so it resumes when re-connected).

Further, if we disconnect the EtherCAT slave for a couple of seconds,
then on reconnect it will send out packets as fast as possible, as if
the data is being buffered somewhere. Does SOEM do this, or does this
occur within the kernel? During the disconnection, our code continues
running at 1 kHz and it does not speed up when connection is
re-established.

Thank you for your help,
