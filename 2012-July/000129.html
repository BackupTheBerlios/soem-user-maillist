</I>Yes, this is not a function that is part of SOEM but of the application.
&gt;<i> Although we are aware (and have verified) that we can sync our loop to

</I>&gt;<i> for the DC time to sync with that of the master (as described in all
</I>&gt;<i> the EtherCAT documentation I've read), not the other way around.
</I>It is very difficult to find an environment for the master (hardware and 
OS) that has a good system clock. Some embedded systems only have a 
32KHz clock, some others are not monotonous. SOEM is OS and hardware 
agnostic so it opts for the master-syncs-with-reference-slave option. 
This is not better or worse than the other way around. The fact that 
EtherCAT documentation seems to prefer one method says nothing about the 
quality of other solutions.

But to implement the reference-slave-syncs-with-master is not difficult.

In pseudo code:

main loop
{
     send process data
     receive process data

     new slave reference time = master time - ethercat offset
     FPRW(reference slave, 0x910 , new slave reference time)

     do control stuff

     wait for cycle end
}

The repeated writes to register 0x910 of the reference slave will make 
it lock to the master time.
The ethercat offset is the time difference between the master and the 
reference slave at start (SOEM starts the reference slave with time=0)
