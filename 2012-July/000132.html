&gt;<i> I have two questions to ask and one patch that I would like to be considered.
</I>First of all, many thanks for giving feedback. So few people do that.
&gt;<i> First, is SOEM threadsafe? If not, it's not difficult to make my send
</I>&gt;<i> and receive (which may be called from different threads) thread-safe.
</I>Yes SOEM is threadsafe. It was build from the ground up to be like that. 
See also the example programs ebox.c and red_test.c
&gt;<i> Second, I notice that SOEM polls its socket to receive data.
</I>Yes, this is deliberate. I tried many different approaches to get the 
best possible RT performance under Linux. SOEM uses RAW sockets to get 
the EtherCAT packets over the line. The socket polls are blocking, 
contrary to the comments in the code and the documentation.  But the 
blocking is extremely short. So for all practical reasons they behave 
like non-blocking calls. The important distinction is that it allows the 
scheduler to do its magic, while at the same time prevent the thread to 
go in the waiting cue. So it balances the CPU polling cost with 
low-latency. This works for most current Intel processors. For some ARM 
and other slower single core systems there might be some tweaks necessary.

In  ec_setupnic
    /* we use RAW packet socket, with packet type ETH_P_ECAT */
    *psock = socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, htons(ETH_P_ECAT));
    timeout.tv_sec =  0;
    timeout.tv_usec = 1;

    r = setsockopt(*psock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, &amp;timeout, 
sizeof(timeout));
    r = setsockopt(*psock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDTIMEO, &amp;timeout, 
sizeof(timeout));

The SO_RCVTIMEO is set at 1 usec. So the recv() call in ec_recvpkt will 
block for a maximum of 1 usec. In reality this is much longer (somewhere 
around 3 usec). In a not too big EtherCAT system the send -&gt; receive 
delay is only 3 to 5 usec. So this timeout makes sense.  It does depend 
a lot on the NIC driver used. There is a really large spread in linux 
NIC driver quality with regards to latency. Some drivers can be tweaked 
with for example ethtool, others are just no good for RT work.

&gt;<i> As we run
</I>&gt;<i> a hard-realtime system where our code has a realtime priority higher
</I>&gt;<i> than 50 (on an RT-PREEMPT) system, it's strongly preferable for SOEM
</I>&gt;<i> to block until new data is available.
</I>Setting the thread priority over 50  can cause all kind of issues. The 
socket layer also operates largely at prio 50, so the application will 
starve the network stack. It can be done, but you need to tweak all kind 
of kernel prio settings too.
&gt;<i>   The attached patch causes SOEM
</I>&gt;<i> to block when __unix__ is defined without sacrificing portability to
</I>&gt;<i> systems without a select() call.
</I>And at the same time this patch makes SOEM non-reentrant. SOEM manages 
its own packet coherence stack. With EtherCAT there is always a send &lt;-&gt; 
receive packet match. So SOEM keeps track of all packets send (with idx 
field) and compares all received packets with this list. Only when there 
is a timeout on receive the transmit packet in the list is dropped. In 
the re-entrant case it is very well possible that ec_inframe gets an 
other packet than it expects (from activity in other threads). This is 
fine because it will still compare the packet with the list and copies 
it in the receive stack. When there is a match with the expected packet 
it returns with that pointer. When the ec_inframe finds its packet 
already available in the receive stack it will just return that pointer 
without making any call to the socket layer.

Your patch will block this functionality for a large degree. Because the 
packet might already have been received and put in the buffer. The 
select() will block until timeout, only then to find the packet was 
already there.

&gt;<i> Third, is there a repository for SOEM's source code?
</I>Not yet, but this might change in the near future.

Thanks,
Arthur
