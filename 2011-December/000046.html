<PRE>Hi,

I have just discovered SOEM. I have used TwinCAT a little but have found the system restriction frustrating (32 bit OS only, particular Intel NIC). All our machines are 64-bit with a variety of hardware.

On the device side I am developing reference designs using the Beckhoff ET1810 slave controller for Altera FPGA. I am looking for solutions for a master to connect to these slaves.

I have a few questions.

I seems that SOEM is much more forgiving and will run on a range of hardware so long as it runs Linux, is that correct?

Will it work with any NIC (within reason)?

Is some realtime flavour of Linux essential?

Does SOEM support real time operation of the network like TwinCAT?  I believe it's the real time which is hard on Windows, and leads to the OS/hardware restrictions mentioned above?

Do you think it is feasible to port SOEM to embedded hardware running something like uC/OS-II? I can use the NicheStack which I believe supports access to RAW sockets.

I would be grateful for any answers received.

Regards,

Andrew
