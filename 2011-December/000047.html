<PRE>&gt;<i> I have just discovered SOEM. I have used TwinCAT a little but have 
</I>&gt;<i> found the system restriction frustrating (32 bit OS only, particular 
</I>&gt;<i> Intel NIC). All our machines are 64-bit with a variety of hardware.
</I>
TwinCAT 3 will include support for 64-bit machines. However, it is known when 
this software is to be published (recently, it was announced that it will be 
published on the 4th quarter of 2011, still nothing).
 
&gt;<i> I seems that SOEM is much more forgiving and will run on a range of 
</I>&gt;<i> hardware so long as it runs Linux, is that correct?
</I>
It can be ported to Windows too, as long as you can provide efficient raw 
socket communication and real-time context.

&gt;<i> Will it work with any NIC (within reason)?
</I>
Any NIC that have driver support on the target OS (or device).
 
&gt;<i> Is some realtime flavour of Linux essential?
</I>
It depends on application.
 
&gt;<i> Does SOEM support real time operation of the network like TwinCAT? 
</I>&gt;<i>  I believe it's the real time which is hard on Windows, and leads to 
</I>&gt;<i> the OS/hardware restrictions mentioned above?
</I>
No. It depends how (and where) the NIC software driver is implemented. You 
have to patch (rewrite) native drivers in order to support real-time context 
of the standard NICs. Some ideas are presented in EtherLab software 
(www.etherlab.org). You may use different approaches.
 
&gt;<i> Do you think it is feasible to port SOEM to embedded hardware 
</I>&gt;<i> running something like uC/OS-II? I can use the NicheStack which I 
</I>&gt;<i> believe supports access to RAW sockets.
</I>
One of the beautiful things about SOEM is that it fits embedded design 
workflow. It is written in plain C, so very easy to port to embedded 
architectures (as opposed to some other solutions bounded to PC 
architectures). You will have to adapt nicdrv.c to support sockets in target 
platform.

&gt;<i> I would be grateful for any answers received.
</I>
Glad if my comments helped you.
