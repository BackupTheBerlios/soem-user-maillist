<PRE>Hi Mladen and Andrew,
&gt;<i> I have just discovered SOEM. I have used TwinCAT a little but have
</I>&gt;<i> found the system restriction frustrating (32 bit OS only, particular
</I>&gt;<i> Intel NIC). All our machines are 64-bit with a variety of hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> TwinCAT 3 will include support for 64-bit machines. However, it is known when
</I>&gt;<i> this software is to be published (recently, it was announced that it will be
</I>&gt;<i> published on the 4th quarter of 2011, still nothing).
</I> From the mailing I've got it is oficially announced now. Delivery to be 
early 2012. I know of some beta testers already here in The Netherlands.
&gt;&gt;<i> I seems that SOEM is much more forgiving and will run on a range of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardware so long as it runs Linux, is that correct?
</I>&gt;<i> It can be ported to Windows too, as long as you can provide efficient raw
</I>&gt;<i> socket communication and real-time context.
</I>It has been ported to many different targets already.
-Plain windows (32 and 64) using WinPcap as NIC driver.
-Windows with Ardence RT toolkit.
-Linux, I86, ARM, PPC, M68000, microblaze, MIPS, BlackFin....
-Embedded with various OS (or bare metal), on the same uP as above.

It has full support for both little and big endian targets.
&gt;&gt;<i> Will it work with any NIC (within reason)?
</I>&gt;<i> Any NIC that have driver support on the target OS (or device).
</I>All SOEM needs are a transmit and receive packet (RAW) method. And that 
not even needs to be with DMA. Polling will suffice. So you can leave 
the Ethernet stack in the company safe. It is just that for a Linux 
target it is easy to use the RAW socket interface. Every Linux standard 
NIC driver will just work out of the box. Even WiFi devices will be 
happy to transport EtherCAT packets for you (even if real time behaviour 
is down the drain then).
&gt;&gt;<i> Is some realtime flavour of Linux essential?
</I>&gt;<i> It depends on application.
</I>It completly depends on your definition of real-time. If 1 second is 
real time, all will work well with any OS. If you want to do 20KHz 
cycles with no drops then you need to choose your OS and hardware very 
carefull.  With the state of things today you can run 5KHz with Linux 
and Intel uP in combination with the Preempt-RT patch.
&gt;&gt;<i> Does SOEM support real time operation of the network like TwinCAT?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   I believe it's the real time which is hard on Windows, and leads to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the OS/hardware restrictions mentioned above?
</I>&gt;<i> No. It depends how (and where) the NIC software driver is implemented. You
</I>&gt;<i> have to patch (rewrite) native drivers in order to support real-time context
</I>&gt;<i> of the standard NICs. Some ideas are presented in EtherLab software
</I>&gt;<i> (www.etherlab.org). You may use different approaches.
</I>The IgH EtherCAT master is the technically fastest approach if you are 
happy with a Linux only solution. It follows the Linux Kernel-&gt;User 
model. The EtherCAT master is written as a Kernel driver/server. Your 
application is then a User mode client that calls the Kernel server. 
RTAI or Xenomai can be added to implement strict RT behaviour.

SOEM on the other hand is just a driver lib that has no specific OS 
affinity. Your application just links in SOEM. It also has a very low 
code footprint. The memory structures are strictly static (compile time 
defined) and can be adjusted to fit your target platform.
&gt;&gt;<i> Do you think it is feasible to port SOEM to embedded hardware
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> running something like uC/OS-II? I can use the NicheStack which I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe supports access to RAW sockets.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the beautiful things about SOEM is that it fits embedded design
</I>&gt;<i> workflow. It is written in plain C, so very easy to port to embedded
</I>&gt;<i> architectures (as opposed to some other solutions bounded to PC
</I>&gt;<i> architectures). You will have to adapt nicdrv.c to support sockets in target
</I>&gt;<i> platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would be grateful for any answers received.
</I>&gt;<i> Glad if my comments helped you.
</I>Mladen, I'm happy you help me out with replies to the soem list. It 
saves me lots of work. Questions like Andrews just reminds me how much 
more work needs to be done on documentation.

And Andrew, perhaps good to know, I also provide an open source slave 
stack SOES.
